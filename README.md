# RGB_Depth
This code is used to project Point Cloud data which is captured by depth camera to the 2D image which is captured by the RGB camera.

1. RGBD.m is the main function to control the program and set the data path. 
2. project.m is the key part.
3. shotfolder.zip contains some experiment data.

This program is still working.
